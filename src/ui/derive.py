"""Display-level derivations for the I4 first-release UI (presentation).

Every function here is a PURE function over values that authorized serving
operations (Q1–Q10) actually return. Constraints (D16-11; D23 §18(9)):

* no file access, no baseline access, no storage of any kind — inputs are
  the served documents alone;
* canonical values are never reinterpreted or mutated: a value that is not
  a valid number in its as-published text form is reported as such (and
  excluded from numeric aggregates with an explicit count) — never
  defaulted, never coerced by locale rules;
* deterministic: same inputs give byte-identical outputs (no clock, no
  randomness, no environment reads).

The documented definitions implemented here are the single source of truth
for the UI's derived presentation values (mirrored 1:1 by the static
frontend; see the TASK62 implementation record).
