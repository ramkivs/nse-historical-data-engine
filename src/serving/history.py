"""Serving query-history store — class-(4) serving-owned user state (D37-DEC).

Governing decisions (docs/architecture/D37_SAVED_QUERY_HISTORY_DECISION.md):

* **C2(a)** — query history may be recorded **only through an explicit
  operation**. Executing an ordinary query (including a saved-query run) never
  implicitly mutates durable history. The single explicit operation is
  :func:`record_execution` (CLI ``history record``): it accepts a validated
  execution description (a supported Q1–Q10 mode + exact parameters), executes
  it through the existing query layer (the invocation IS the explicit execution
  request — no hidden side effects), and durably records the ACTUAL outcome.
  An execution that never happened is never recorded (no fabricated outcomes).
* **C1(a)** (still binding) — history is serving-owned user state in its own
  **distinct root** (``--history-state``), separate from the derived-state root
  and from the saved-query store root; derived-state rebuild never reaches it;
  deletion is explicit (``history delete``); there is no retention policy and
  no automatic pruning.

Authority: the standing D23 grant and the D37-DEC deferral clause ("its own
design record under the same standing authority"); technology selection
recorded in the D39 implementation record under the D23 §13 delegation with
the MD-10 grading. Design decisions (recording semantics, seq identity, no
timestamp, minimal entry content) are documented in the D39 record as the
narrowest decisions consistent with the governing records — proposals
elevated by that record, not new authority.

Entry contract (format ``serving-query-history/1.0``)::

    {
      "format": "serving-query-history/1.0",
      "next_seq": 3,
      "entries": [
        {"seq": 1, "mode": "<query-id>", "params": { ... }, "outcome": "success"},
        {"seq": 2, "mode": "<query-id>", "params": { ... }, "outcome": "error", "check": "<check>"}
      ]
    }

* ``mode``/``params`` — the exact execution description, validated by the SAME
  contract as saved-query definitions (the ten Q1–Q10 query ids; exact,
  as-published parameter values; nothing else).
* ``outcome`` — the actual outcome of the explicitly requested execution:
  ``"success"`` or ``"error"``.
* ``check`` — present iff outcome is ``"error"``: the fail-closed check id of
  the query failure. No result rows are ever stored, no result counts, no
  timestamps (the determinism contract admits no clock value into this
  durable state), and no provenance or qualification fields (never invented).
* ``seq`` — stable record identifier: a 1-based monotonically increasing
  integer, unique, **never reused** (even after deletion). The document's
  ``next_seq`` counter (the next seq a recording may use) is incremented on
  every recording and never decremented, so deletion cannot free a seq for
  reuse. Entry order is ascending ``seq`` = the order of the explicit
  recording operations. Repeated identical descriptions are NOT collapsed —
  every explicit recording produces a new entry.
* ``next_seq`` — integer >= 1; must be strictly greater than every stored
  entry seq (schema-validated on load; a violation is a fail-closed
  ``history-schema``).

Failure semantics (fail closed; no partial publication):

* ``history-missing``      — store file or sidecar absent where a store is required;
* ``history-corrupt``      — sidecar digest mismatch or unparseable JSON;
* ``history-format``       — unknown/unsupported store format version;
* ``history-schema``       — document/entry key-set violation or seq ordering
  violation (non-contract keys, seq not strictly ascending, ...);
* ``history-invalid``      — a stored entry's mode/params violates the
  definition contract (checked on load);
* ``history-not-found``    — read/delete of an unknown seq;
* ``history-state-conflict`` — the history root equals the derived-state root.

A *fresh* execution description violating the definition contract (in
``record_execution``) raises the shared ``SavedQueryError`` (check
``saved-query-invalid``) before anything is published — it is a fresh-input
validation error, not a store-state failure.

A baseline or derived-state failure during ``history record`` aborts the
operation with **no entry published** (there was no completed execution to
record). A query failure IS recorded (it is the actual outcome of the explicit
request) with its check id.
