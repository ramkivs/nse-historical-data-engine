"""Serving query surface (D16-10) — the slice's query categories.

Q1 dataset/partition selection + yearly summaries, Q2 date-range query, Q3
instrument query, Q4 exact-value filters, Q5 identity/association queries,
and Q6 calendar queries. Semantics of Q3, verified against the governing
contract (D16-10 Q3; D05 §§3.1/5/6/8):

* instrument = (listing_symbol, series) — dated attributes, never durable identity
  (D05 §3.1: "SYMBOL never durable"; 845 ISINs with multiple symbols); ISIN is a
  non-identity attribute and is NOT a query key here;
* match = exact equality of the as-published ``listing_symbol`` and ``series``
  values (no case/whitespace normalisation, no expression language — D23 §10: no
  arbitrary query semantics outside the established Q1–Q10/saved-query boundary);
* results carry the canonical row exactly as stored: as-published field values
  (``source_values``; ``None`` = absent in that family, ``""`` = blank — neither is
  ever defaulted, D05 §2 rule 3), non-gating flags, ``business_date``, and the row's
  own D05 §8 provenance block;
* ``raw_line`` (retained raw text, L1 retention) is NOT part of the served view:
  serving exposes verbatim as-published field values; raw row text exposure would
  require a future explicit decision in the spirit of D16-08 class-5 exclusions;
* ordering is deterministic: (business_date, format_family, year, source file,
  source line number);
* read-only: the query streams class-(1) files and writes nothing; a query failure
  can never corrupt durable data (D16-09 invariant).

    Two governed selector forms over ``w2/associations.jsonl`` (the class-(2)
    W2 output; D05 §3.2/§3.3), plus their composition:

    * **identity** — ``security_id`` only: the identity document for that exact
      as-published correlation key (normalized ISIN; D05 §6.1) with all of its
      dated-association intervals as published;
    * **instrument** — ``symbol`` **and** ``series`` (both, exact as-published
      strings): every dated-association interval in every identity document
      whose (symbol, series) matches exactly — the instrument's "related
      records", across identities;
    * **combined** — all three: that identity's intervals restricted to the
      (symbol, series) pair (the single contract-supported composition).

    Semantics, per the governing contract (D05 §3.2/§3.3/§3.5; D16-10 Q5;
    D23 §8/§10):

    * **exact-value matching only** — selectors are compared verbatim to the
      as-published stored values (the engine already normalized the key; no
      case/whitespace folding, no expression language, no aliasing or
      inference of relationships);
    * **absent is never an error** — a missing ``w2/associations.jsonl``, an
      unknown identity, or an unknown instrument all yield an empty result
      (served with ``associations_present`` at the CLI level);
    * **as-published serving** — the document is served exactly as stored
      (its 10-key ``SecurityIdentity`` / 10-key ``DatedAssociation`` shape,
      including ``is_valid_isin_format: null`` where undetermined and the
      non-promotion note) plus the Q5 ``serving`` envelope;
    * **overlay rows appear in no document** (the engine excludes them at
      ingestion, D05 §3.5) — Q5 neither aggregates nor exposes overlay
      observations;
    * **ordering is file order** — the engine's sorted normalized-ISIN key
      order with published association order within each document; never
      re-sorted;
    * **fail closed** — malformed selectors or a malformed present file raise
      :class:`QueryError` before anything is served (no partial output).

    ``index`` is accepted for boundary consistency (every Q path takes the
    verified class-(4) index) but supplies no Q5 file narrowing: Q5's file
    set is fixed (the single class-(2) file) and the index format is
    unchanged. ``documents`` may carry a result already returned by
    :func:`parse_associations` (the CLI does so to serve the
    ``associations_present`` marker from the same single pass); omitted
    callers get the parse performed here. Read-only: the file is streamed
    and nothing is written.

    Read-only serving of ``w2/calendar.jsonl`` (the class-(2) W2 output;
    D05 §3.4), with the ``w2/metrics.json`` calendar blocks cross-checked
    against the served records:

    * **full** — no bounds: every calendar day as published, in file order
      (the engine's strictly ascending ``trade_date`` order — never
      re-sorted);
    * **range** — ``date_from`` and ``date_to`` (both, inclusive, ISO
      YYYY-MM-DD, exact as-published string comparison — Q2 semantics):
      the days with ``date_from <= trade_date <= date_to``; ``date_from >
      date_to`` is an empty range → empty result, not an error.

    Display semantics, per the governing contract (D05 §3.4; D16-10 Q6;
    D23 §8 item 1):

    * the four ``label_status`` states are served exactly as published and
      kept distinct: a sourced ``official-holiday`` carries its
      ``official_holiday_label`` / ``label_circular`` / ``label_registry_id``;
      ``unexplained-by-obtained-circulars`` and ``not-retrieved`` keep
      ``official_holiday_label: null`` — the cause is **never filled in**,
      never defaulted, never inferred from the status or the date;
    * ``trad_dt_eq_biz_dt: null`` (legacy N/A / missing) served as null,
      never defaulted to false;
    * ``notes`` served as published text, never reinterpreted;
    * the file-presence/circular divergence (a present day labelled
      official-holiday) is served as stored — the calendar stores the
      divergence, it does not reconcile it.

    Absence and failure (D16-08: serving never fabricates class-(2)
    content): both W2 calendar files absent → a legitimate empty result
    (served with ``calendar_present`` at the CLI level); a present
    malformed file or a metrics/records contradiction fails closed before
    anything is served (no partial output). ``index`` is accepted for
    boundary consistency (every Q path takes the verified class-(4) index)
    but supplies no Q6 file narrowing — the file set is fixed and the index
    format is unchanged. ``documents`` / ``metrics`` may carry results
    already returned by :func:`parse_calendar` (and the metrics loader) so
    the CLI serves the ``calendar_present`` marker from the same single
    pass. Read-only: the files are streamed and nothing is written.
