"""Q7 record detail (D16-10 Q7) — one canonical row plus its archive facts.

Contract (D16-10 Q7; D22 §6; D23 §§9-10):

* A Q7 result provides, for exactly one canonical row:
  1. the selected canonical row, served exactly as Q2/Q3 serve rows —
     as-published field values, the row's own D05 §8 provenance block, the
     serving envelope, and ``raw_line`` excluded (L1 retention is not part of
     the served view — D16-08 class-5 exclusions);
  2. the applicable archive facts from ``INPUT_MANIFEST.jsonl`` (as published,
     no invented defaults — the Q9 parser is reused, not duplicated);
  3. the reconciliation records applicable to that archive from
     ``RECONCILIATION.jsonl`` (as published, in file order; an archive with no
     applicable records yields an empty list — absence is a valid state, not
     an error).

Row identity (established; no new identifier introduced):

* A row is selected by ``(source_file, source_line_number)`` — ``source_file``
  is the row file exactly as served in the Q2/Q3 ``serving`` envelope
  (``serving.source_file``), and ``source_line_number`` is the row's canonical
  D05 §8 field (its line number within the source member, as stored on the
  row). Within one row file ``source_line_number`` is unique (each member data
  line produces at most one row), so the pair identifies exactly one row —
  stably, even where quarantined lines mean the row's position in the file
  differs from its member line number.

Row-to-archive join (schema-supported, digest-verified — no inference from
display symbols, dates, or file ordering):

* The runner (``tools/i4_runner/i4_inputs.build_source``) constructs the row's
  provenance strictly from the governed D01 inventory facts, and the
  ``INPUT_MANIFEST`` record (written by the same runner) carries those same
  facts. The join key is therefore the provenance triple
  ``(source_archive, member_name, archive_sha256)`` matched against the
  record's ``(file_name, member_name, archive_sha256_d01)`` — a digest-
  verified identity relationship, corroborated by ``row.format_family ==
  record.engine_family``. A missing, absent, or ambiguous match is an
  identity inconsistency: fail closed, never an arbitrary archive.

Reconciliation applicability:

* A ``RECONCILIATION.jsonl`` record applies to an archive exactly when its
  ``input_identity`` is a member scope (``scope == "member"``) whose
  ``(root, relative_path)`` equals the archive's. Corpus-scoped records apply
  to no single archive and are not served per-archive (they belong to the
  corpus-level quality/evidence views, Q8/Q10 — out of scope here).

Fail-closed: unknown row file, unknown row, malformed or contract-violating
INPUT_MANIFEST / RECONCILIATION records, or an identity inconsistency all
raise before any partial output is produced. Read-only: the query streams
class-(1) row files and opens the two package metadata documents; it writes
nothing and produces no serving state (the class-(4) index is read, never
rebuilt, by Q7).
